                        <p>An alcoholic beverage (also called an alcoholic drink, adult beverage, or simply a drink) is
                            a drink that contains
                            ethanol, a type of alcohol that acts as a drug and is produced by fermentation of grains,
                            fruits, or other sources of
                            sugar. The consumption of alcoholic drinks, often referred to as "drinking", plays an
                            important social role in many
                            cultures. Most countries have laws regulating the production, sale, and consumption of
                            alcoholic beverages.
                            Regulations may require the labeling of the percentage alcohol content (as ABV or proof) and
                            the use of a warning label.
                            Some countries ban such activities entirely, but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of
                            the world. The global
                            alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2018.

                            Alcohol is a depressant, which in low doses causes euphoria, reduces anxiety, and increases
                            sociability. In higher
                            doses, it causes drunkenness, stupor, unconsciousness, or death. Long-term use can lead to
                            an alcohol use disorder, an
                            increased risk of developing several types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and physical
                            dependence.

                            Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world, and about 33% of all
                            humans currently drink
                            alcohol. In 2015, among Americans, 86% of adults had consumed alcohol at some point, with
                            70% drinking it in the last
                            year and 56% in the last month. Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three
                            classes—beers, wines, and
                            spirits—and typically their alcohol content is between 3% and 50%.

                            Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented drinks existed at
                            least as early as the Neolithic
                            period (c. 10,000 BC). Several other animals are affected by alcohol similarly to humans
                            and, once they consume it,
                            will consume it again if given the opportunity, though humans are the only species known to
                            produce alcoholic drinks
                            intentionally.</p>
